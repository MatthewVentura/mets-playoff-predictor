# Mets Playoff Predictor: Neural Network Sabermetric Model

This project began as a mathematics symposium presentation during my undergraduate studies.

What started as a school assignment quickly turned into a passion project focused on my favorite team ‚Äî the New York Mets.

### üéØ Objective:
Use real sabermetrics and historical MLB data to build a machine learning model that predicts a team‚Äôs playoff chances. The spotlight: quantifying the impact of adding Juan Soto to the 2024 Mets roster.

## ‚öæÔ∏è Features Used in the Model (21 total)

- WAR, PA, HR, R, RBI  
- BB%, K%, ISO, AVG, OBP, SLG  
- wOBA, wRC+, OFF, DEF, BSR  
- ERA, WHIP, DefEff, RTOT, Defensive Runs Saved
